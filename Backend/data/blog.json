This backtesting engine doesn't account for things like: Brokerage fees (these eat into profits) Slippage (when your order fills at a slightly different price than expected) Market microstructure (the detailed interactions of orders in a market) Building a functional (for backtesting) algorithmic trading engine feels like a massive win. It's awesome to see theoretical concepts turn into working code. You can view the full codebase here: https://github.com/JohannesMeyerYC/AlgorithmicTradingEngine Stay Calculated!"

It shows the relationship between something you want to predict, like a stock price, and one or more independent variables, such as a market index or interest rates. Its biggest perks are its simplicity and how easy it is to understand. The model's coefficients give you a clear, transparent view of how each factor influences the outcome, which is super helpful when you need to explain decisions to stakeholders and regulators. But here's the catch: financial markets are rarely simple or linear. Linear regression's assumptions often get violated by real world financial data. That data is noisy, non linear, and often has variables that are highly correlated. To fix these issues, we use regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso regression. **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization):** This adds a penalty that discourages the model's coefficients from getting too big. This helps prevent overfitting, which is when the model learns the noise instead of the real signal. It also stabilizes the model when features are correlated. **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization):** This also adds a penalty but has a cool ability to shrink some coefficients all the way to zero. This basically does automatic feature selection, giving you a simpler, more understandable model that only uses the most important predictors. Choosing between simple linear regression and its regularized versions means weighing interpretability against predictive power. While linear regression is transparent, the complexity of modern markets often calls for the robustness of Ridge and Lasso, even if it makes the model a little less straightforward to understand."

Each node in the tree is a decision based on a feature, and each branch is the result of that decision. They are easy to visualize and can pick up on non linear relationships without needing complex data transformations. However, a single decision tree is very likely to overfit. It can get too complex and essentially memorize the training data, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data. Random Forests fix this problem using an ensemble technique. Instead of building one tree, a Random Forest builds hundreds or even thousands of them. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and only considers a random subset of features for each split. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all the individual trees. This \"wisdom of the crowd\" approach dramatically reduces overfitting, boosts accuracy, and improves the model's ability to work well with new market conditions. While one tree is easy to interpret, a forest of trees is less so. That's a common trade off for better performance.  [Image of Decision Tree Structure]"

This iterative process lets the model focus on the instances that are hardest to predict, steadily improving its accuracy. **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):** This is a highly efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting. It's known for its speed and performance and includes built in regularization to prevent overfitting. **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine):** Another optimized framework designed for even more speed and efficiency, especially with very large datasets.

Their dominance shows the industry's focus on predictive accuracy and computational speed.

Maximizing this margin makes the model robust and helps it perform well on new data. A key trick with SVMs is the \"kernel trick.\" This lets them model complex, non linear relationships. By mapping the data into a higher dimensional space, SVMs can find a linear separation that just wouldn't be possible in the original space. They work well in high dimensional spaces and can even perform nicely with limited training data, which is useful when you're modeling rare financial events. SVMs are a good middle ground between the simplicity of logistic regression and the complexity of deep neural networks. "

The gold standard here is **walk forward optimization**. In this method, the model is trained on a window of historical data, called the \"in sample\" period. Then, it's tested on the next, subsequent period of data, which is the \"out of sample\" period. This process is then rolled forward in time, simulating how the model would have performed in a real world trading scenario. This gives you a much more realistic estimate of a model's future performance. It's also crucial to avoid data snooping. This happens when the same data is used repeatedly to pick models and fine tune parameters, leading to overfitting and results that look artificially good. A strict separation between training, validation, and final test data is absolutely essential."

The unique nature of financial data demands specialized approaches, and the \"black box\" problem requires a strong commitment to interpretability and responsible AI. As we look ahead, the rise of autonomous agents, the explosion of alternative data, and the dawn of quantum computing promise to push the boundaries even further. Success in this new frontier will belong to those who can master both the technical and ethical sides of these powerful technologies. It needs a blend of deep financial insight, rigorous scientific methodology, and a commitment to building transparent, robust, and fair systems.

The white-collar, entry-level roles that a college graduate is supposed to step into are prime targets for automation. The Forum notes that AI could replace over half the tasks in jobs like market research and sales. This reality destroys the \"climb the ladder\" strategy. What ladder is there to climb when the first rungs are being automated away? This leads to a critical problem: if the main way to earn an income is sputtering, the entire wealth-building journey stalls before it even begins.

A 2024 survey by the World Economic Forum found that a striking 41% of Gen Z would trust an AI assistant to manage their investments. We are far more likely to get into cryptocurrency and use micro-investing apps than any previous generation.

That old idea of corporate security is being challenged by a pretty provocative thought: \"As an entrepreneur you are more likely to use AI; as a corporate employee you are more likely to be used or replaced by AI.\" This idea completely flips the script on what \"risk\" even means. Those high paying, brainy jobs that used to be the gold standard of corporate safety are now prime targets for automation.

A Finnish student named Linus Torvalds first created it back in 1991. The kernel is the master conductor of your computer’s orchestra. It talks to your hardware (like your CPU, memory, and storage), manages all the programs you're running, and makes sure everything works together smoothly. It’s the unsung hero making your digital life possible. Now, how do you tell this powerful kernel what you want it to do? That’s where the **shell** comes in. The shell is your command line interpreter. It’s your direct line to the operating system, often seen as that \"terminal window\" where you type commands. While graphical interfaces are great for many tasks, the shell gives you incredible power and precision. It’s like having a direct conversation with your computer.

It's pretty user friendly, packed with features like command history (so you don’t have to retype everything) and tab completion (a fantastic time saver that auto completes commands and filenames). **Zsh** (Z Shell): Think of Zsh as Bash’s cool, highly customizable cousin. Zsh is a favorite among developers and power users because it offers even more advanced features, like smarter auto correction for typos and amazing plugin support (you might hear about \"Oh My Zsh\" which makes it even cooler). Don't let the command line scare you! It's a skill, and like any skill, it just takes a bit of practice. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll unlock a new level of control and efficiency.

The root user has unlimited power; they can do absolutely anything on the system. For your everyday tasks, you'll be a regular user with fewer privileges. But what if you need to install new software or change an important system setting? That’s where **sudo** comes in. sudo stands for \"superuser do\" (or sometimes \"substitute user do\"). It's a brilliant command that lets a permitted regular user execute a single command with root privileges. You type `sudo` before the command you want to run, and the system will ask for your password (not the root password) to confirm you’re allowed to do it. This is much safer than logging in as the root user all the time because it limits how often those all powerful privileges are used. It's like having a special key that only works for one specific door, just one time. Some versions of Linux, like Ubuntu, really emphasize using sudo and even disable direct root login by default for extra safety. Smart."

      "text": "Let's talk money: quant roles are famous for their hefty paychecks. It's not unusual for undergraduates to step into positions with total compensation packages ranging from $100,000 all the way up to $400,000 or even more. For those with several years under their belt, earnings can climb into the upper six figures and even cross the seven-figure mark. For instance, the average salary for quant traders was reported around $95,386 as of early 2025, with a significant range depending on the firm and experience, while quantitative analysts might see a median total pay around $253,000 in 2024. Bonuses can be substantial, with some top firms offering new graduates first-year guarantees exceeding $500,000. Beyond the impressive salaries, the intellectual stimulation is a major draw. Quant work is a playground for the academically inclined, requiring a diverse toolkit drawing from statistics, mathematics, computer science, data science, and machine learning. The job is often compared to academia in its research aspects; quants are constantly trying to develop new strategies or refine existing ones, a task that places a high value on creativity. It's a field where you're paid to solve complex, intellectually stimulating problems using advanced mathematical and statistical techniques. The environment is dynamic, always demanding innovative thinking to find new profitable opportunities in ever-changing markets. Many also appreciate a culture that often feels closer to the tech world than traditional finance. This can mean more relaxed teams, less bureaucracy, and perks like free food, good benefits, and fitness incentives, mirroring those found in leading tech companies. For some, this environment is significantly less stressful than what they might have experienced in a traditional banking setting. Furthermore, quants can have a direct and tangible impact on financial markets and the investment decisions of major organizations. The high demand for these skills also translates into opportunities for rapid career advancement for those who excel."

      "text": "However, the path of a quant is not without its thorns. The high rewards often come with high pressure. Trading, a common quant activity, is a domain where a single bad decision can lead to losses in the tens of thousands of dollars, meaning you need to be sharp and focused all the time. Forget about coasting on a Friday if you're feeling a bit worse for wear; the market waits for no one. Schedules tend to be inflexible, taking a day off isn't a simple affair, and for traders, working from home is practically unheard of. The field, particularly trading, is also known for being very young, with a median age often appearing to be under 30. This isn't necessarily a negative in itself, but it can point to a potential lack of long-term sustainability in certain high-stress roles. The intensity and constant performance expectations lead many older traders to look for less demanding positions, perhaps in quant research. Many firms foster a \"make it or break it\" atmosphere: perform well, and you'll be compensated handsomely; fail to meet expectations, and you could be out the door. In a way, those high salaries are partly compensating for the career risk you're shouldering. A crucial trait for survival is being comfortable with failure. The financial markets are incredibly dynamic, and even the most brilliant, seemingly foolproof ideas can fall flat. Aspiring quants must be able to detach from a failing concept and quickly pivot to new models and ideas, rather than stubbornly trying to make a broken strategy work. The environment can be intense and aggressive, demanding an ability to thrive under pressure, maintain unwavering focus during long hours, and stomach setbacks. And, of course, the competition is fierce. The allure of big salaries and intellectual challenges draws many candidates, making it tough to land a role, especially at top-tier funds and investment banks. The very nature of the work, while intellectually stimulating for many, can also be perceived as abstract and narrow. Unlike fundamental analysts who might read annual reports, meet company management, or talk to shareholders, quants spend most of their time immersed in computer code and numbers on a screen. For individuals with broader interests or a desire for management roles involving more interpersonal interaction, this intense focus might not be the ideal fit. Some PhDs transitioning from academia find they miss the deep, extended research environment, as the pace of a trading desk often demands solutions in days or hours, precluding major theoretical breakthroughs."

If you're aiming for a quant job, universities often look for degrees in subjects like Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, Computer Science, or Statistics. These disciplines provide the essential grounding in abstract thinking and logical reasoning that hiring managers value; the thinking is that it's easier to teach a mathematician about finance than to teach a finance student advanced mathematics. While a bachelor's degree in a quantitative subject is a good start, advanced degrees are highly favorable and often expected, especially for research-heavy roles or positions at top-tier firms. **Master's Degrees:** Programs like a Master of Financial Engineering (MFE), Master of Mathematical Finance (MMF), or a Master's in Computational Finance are common pathways. **Ph.D’s:** A doctorate in a mathematical discipline like Physics, Engineering, Computer Science, or even mathematical finance itself, is particularly valued for roles that demand independent research capabilities, often cultivated in top-tier funds. For quant research (QR) roles, proficiency at a Master's or PhD level in math and statistics is generally the norm. Regardless of the degree level, certain academic subjects are paramount:"

The \"Calculated\" Impact: Saves 3-4 hours a week on graphic design, especially for social media content. It allows me to create visually appealing content faster without deep design skills. This is key for AI efficiency in marketing. My Hack: Use Text to Image for abstract concepts. Instead of trying to find the perfect stock photo for \"financial anxiety,\" I can generate something unique that evokes the feeling. Less time searching, more time creating."

Here’s my no-BS filter, the same critical thinking I apply to investments or business decisions: **Identify Your Biggest Time Sinks FIRST:** Don't start with the tool. Start with your pain. What tasks consistently eat up your hours and deliver low ROI for your effort? For me, it was transcription and initial content scaffolding. This is the first step to finding relevant practical AI applications. **Look for Proven, Single-Purpose Tools (Initially):** While all-in-one platforms are emerging, often the best AI tools excel at one thing. Otter is for transcription. Grammarly is for writing. Master these before getting overwhelmed. **Prioritize a Shallow Learning Curve:** If an AI tool takes you days to learn, it’s defeating the purpose of saving time, at least initially. Look for intuitive interfaces. **Does it Actually Integrate with Your Workflow?** A fancy AI tool is useless if it doesn’t play well with how you already work or if it adds more steps than it removes. **Test with Real Work, Ruthlessly:** Use free trials. Throw your actual Young & Calculated tasks at them. If an AI tool for productivity doesn't deliver tangible time savings or quality improvement within that trial, ditch it. No FOMO. **Don’t Chase Every New AI Shiny Object:** The AI space is moving at lightning speed. It's tempting to try everything. Resist. Stick to the AI tools that demonstrably save you time and produce results. Re-evaluate your stack maybe quarterly, not weekly."

They've given me back nearly a full day every week. That’s the power of strategic AI use. So, my challenge to you is this: What’s the ONE repetitive, time-consuming task in your studies, your side-hustle, or your job that you could potentially offload or augment with a practical AI application this week?

Both the US and the Soviet Union poured enormous resources into developing space technologies, which led to breakthroughs in electronics, communication systems, and computer science. In the US, for example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) funded the development of the Apollo program, which ultimately led to the first human landing on the moon in 1969. These achievements not only enhanced the US military’s capabilities but also laid the foundation for commercial satellite communication and the internet, which have had a massive impact on global economic markets. Many of the technological inventions from the Cold War period later found practical uses. For example, the development of satellite communication improved military communication and also laid the groundwork for modern telecommunications. Research in computer science and electronics led to the creation of early computers and the internet, which marked the start of a new era in technology and economic development. [Smith, J. (2024)]"

The US and the USSR each formed separate economic spheres, resulting in limited trade between the two and a redistribution of trade partners around the world. In the early years of the Cold War, the United States followed a policy of international economic cooperation, which led to the establishment of institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. These institutions not only supported Europe's economic recovery after World War II but also promoted global trade by encouraging stability and cooperation. [Campos, R. G., Heid, B., & Timini, J. (2024)] In contrast, the USSR maintained a centralized economy with limited participation in global markets. The Soviet Union focused on self-sufficiency and mostly traded with countries within its own economic sphere, such as Eastern Europe and Cuba. This approach resulted in a lack of competition, which ultimately contributed to the Soviet Union's economic stagnation. The limited trade between the two powers did not only affect their own economies but also reshaped global trade patterns. Countries not aligned with either bloc often struggled to form trade partnerships due to pressure to pick a side. This situation gave rise to the \"non-aligned movement,\" a group of countries that aimed to maintain a neutral position in global politics. [Campos, R. G., Heid, B., & Timini, J. (2024)]"

They also played an active role in shaping global power structures and spreading economic ideologies. The interaction between geopolitical tension, military spending, and financial markets created a dynamic and often unpredictable environment that forced investors, governments, and international institutions to think strategically and respond quickly to volatility. [Markets in War Time (2022)] In 1944, the Bretton Woods system established a new international monetary framework that confirmed the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. This system fixed the exchange rate between the dollar and gold, which promoted stability in international financial markets. However, by the late 1960s, growing US budget deficits, particularly due to the cost of the Vietnam War, put pressure on the dollar. In 1971, President Richard Nixon announced the \"Nixon Shock,\" which removed the dollar from the gold standard and marked the beginning of the end of the Bretton Woods system. Massive US military spending not only affected the national budget but also had a direct impact on financial markets. The increased demand for resources caused inflation, which forced investors to adjust to a new economic reality. The 1970s were marked by a period of **\"stagflation\"**, a mix of economic stagnation and high inflation, which weakened the stability of financial markets. [Markets in War Time (2022)]"

In Russia, the ruble experienced significant devaluation, leading to an inflation rate of **84% in 1998**. Shock therapy in Russia, however, led to a concentration of wealth among a small elite often referred to as “oligarchs.” The lack of proper regulatory frameworks made the transition challenging, resulting in economic instability and the rise of corruption. The financial sector went through major changes. Many Russian banks struggled to survive, and some collapsed during the 1998 financial crisis. However, international banks like Deutsche Bank took advantage of the situation and acquired others such as Bankers Trust. This increased Russia’s integration into the global financial system. Despite early challenges, some former Soviet states like Poland experienced successful economic reforms. Poland’s shock therapy approach led to lower inflation and reduced budget deficits, laying the groundwork for rapid economic growth. In contrast, Russia pushed for fast private-sector reform without sufficient regulation, resulting in an economy with less inclusive growth. Over the past decade, former Soviet countries have increasingly focused on strengthening financial regulation and integrating their markets into the global economy. The European Union, for example, introduced reforms aimed at deepening markets and encouraging long-term investment. These efforts have helped improve financial stability in the region.

The West prioritized free markets and capitalism, while many were surprised when the USSR, despite its socialist principles, developed a massive military-industrial complex. The economic pressure of the Cold War contributed significantly to the ethical dilemmas of the era. At first, both superpowers justified their military spending as necessary for national security, but as the real cost of arms production and the space race became evident, it raised serious questions about priorities. The USA eventually saw how its own financial system was disrupted by war spending, while the USSR realized that its centralized economy could not keep up. Ultimately, the economic struggle forced both sides to act against their original principles: the USA by accepting state intervention in the market, and the USSR by allowing limited market reforms. In the end, both had to acknowledge that their actions, while sometimes contradictory to their ideologies, were seen as necessary in the context of the broader conflict."

Massive military spending led to technological innovation in the USA, such as the development of the internet and satellite communication, while in the USSR, a centrally planned economy worsened economic stagnation. The conflict split international trade into two distinct spheres, with the USA promoting globalisation through institutions like the IMF, and the USSR maintaining its own trade network. Financial markets became more volatile, especially after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, which triggered stagflation and new approaches to monetary policy. After the fall of the USSR in 1991, rapid globalisation accelerated, but also led to economic inequality and corruption in several post-Soviet states. The legacy of the Cold War shows how political competition can shape economic systems, with long-term effects still visible today in areas like technology, trade, and financial stability."

I believe there is great wisdom in this aphorism once you understand that a model is just a simple(r) mathematical representation of a real-world phenomenon. Regarding its application to real-world settings would therefore first involve surveying and exploring the data – let the data tell its story first, before selecting any appropriate modelling technique. Once you have played “data detective” to a sufficient degree in coaching out the secrets of a dataset, only then can one feasibly start experimenting with various modelling techniques (assuming that we would like to predict some phenomenon – there are other use-cases of machine learning as well, keep in mind). Naturally, the greatest challenge lies in **data quality**; most datasets are extremely messy and unordered and full of errors, which is a big challenge to any data science project. Why? Well, reality itself is typically chaotic, which partly explains messy data. And measurement devices or whatever data collection device/software/architecture you are using can and will fail over time, or become uncalibrated/outdated/misapplied, which leads to data errors. In overcoming such a challenge requires good-old fashioned **grit and curiosity**; two aspects that I typically look for in any young data scientist. "

From the moment of the first grain bank in Egypt almost 4000 years ago, the idea of credit risk started to exist, which is the expected loss that a bank suffers from borrowers that may default tomorrow on their loan (i.e., not repay). It is an immensely interesting and dynamic and complex field, especially when trying to predict the various elements of credit risk.

The method by which such a model is trained (maximum likelihood estimation in this case) is both theoretically derived and already practically implemented within statistical software (such as R). There is no real divide, apart from some computational statistics-related adjustments (though even these are deeply embedded within the statistical software). Now of course, there exists some best practices to modelling something, which is why data science is also a craft (not only a science). But even these practices depend heavily on the setting and context. It is not as simple as just calibrating a technique since calibration itself may fail in certain circumstances. In this case, nothing beats a comparative study of many techniques whilst tuning some parameters and experimenting with different variables and transformations; in short, curiosity."

Spending time in formulating the right set of questions is very important; the famous physicist prof. Richard Feynman once said that just **formulating the question is about 50% of the work**. Once formulated, one can proceed with proposing a solution, which involves conducting a brief literature study in discovering what has been done by other scientists in the past on related questions. A proposal document typically spells out the research problem, gives background information, proposes a possible solution(s), outlines the approach to applying the solution (e.g., specifying the required data), and posits some wider implications of the work (i.e., why should we care?). Once the proposal is accepted by whichever interested party, then the research project can start in all earnest; typically by conducting a full-length literature review before touching any data. Afterwards, the data collection/exploration and subsequent modelling phase starts, all while writing up the usual parts of a typical research report/dissertation (Introduction, Background/literature study, Method, Calibration & Results, Conclusion, Appendices). This process typically culminates in a closeout presentation during which the final results are shared and the research question ideally answered conclusively, as accompanied by the research report.

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Over the years, I’ve seen a significant evolution in the qualifications and skill sets that top financial firms seek. Traditionally, professional designations like CA(SA), CFA, and Actuarial Sciences were highly valued, but today they have become more multifaceted. These qualifications now reflect a broader understanding of business and a deep understanding of financial concepts, rather than just being narrowly focused on one dimension. In today’s ever-changing corporate world—where teams are leaner and corporate structures tend to be flatter—candidates are expected to bring more to the table than just the prestige of holding a certain title. Financial firms now increasingly look for individuals who can offer a combination of technical expertise, strategic thinking, and adaptability. While qualifications like Chartered Accountant, CFA Charterholder, or Actuary remain important, there’s a growing emphasis on skills like **data analysis, coding, and proficiency with AI and machine learning tools**. These competencies are now seen as essential for staying ahead in a rapidly digitising landscape. Additionally, companies are prioritising candidates who demonstrate a strong understanding of global market trends, regulatory changes, and **environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors**. Emotional intelligence, leadership in collaborative settings, and the ability to manage change are also key attributes that financial firms are increasingly valuing. An excerpt which I always find apt: According to Douglas Hall, an individual with a protean career is one who actively and constantly updates their career pathway in order to remain relevant to their work environment (Hall, 2004). The word “protean” came from “Proteus”, a Greek god with the ability to constantly change his shape in response to the environment he was in. Thus, Proteus signifies someone who is flexible, versatile and highly adaptable. In career development-speak, an individual with a protean career is characterised by continuous a state of continuous self-assessment, self-direction, and self-development. Due to this individual’s flexibility, they are able to pursue different opportunities whenever it presents itself, explore new industries, and constantly redefine the meaning of success on their own terms, but in relation to the changing work environment. To be ‘protean’ means to adopt an attitude that provides the individual with all the abovementioned level of flexibility and versatility. "

Be it at smaller boutique advisory firms, short internships etc. Grab the opportunity! Equally important is developing strong investment acumen and the ability to interpret equity value drivers within a broader commercial context.

I pay close attention to how candidates engage with the world outside of their immediate role—what they’re reading, what market trends they’re following, or even how they manage their own personal investment portfolios. These interests often give insight into their critical thinking, passion for the industry, and long-term growth mindset. For example, a candidate who actively follows global economic trends, reads thought-provoking books or publications, and enjoys discussing current shifts in technology or finance, tends to bring a broader perspective to problem-solving and innovation. Similarly, someone who is involved in hobbies—whether it’s endurance sports, travel, volunteering, or creative pursuits—often demonstrates resilience, cultural awareness, and the ability to balance diverse interests. These seemingly ‘non-professional’ traits give a fuller picture of who the person is and often highlight qualities like resilience, cultural awareness, and the ability to connect with others—traits that are increasingly important in collaborative and fast-paced environments."

I designed it with safety in mind, by using strict content filters and creating a persona that keeps interactions focused and educational. The app allows kids to ask questions about text or images and store their study notes all in one place. You can find the code for it here: Study Buddy GitHub Repo."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "My advice is to **start with a clear idea of what you want to create**. Instead of diving into courses or books right away, think about a specific project you want to build. For example, if you want to create an iOS app but don’t know where to begin, focus on what kind of app you want, its functionality and design, first. Then, **reverse-engineer the learning process** by figuring out what skills and knowledge you need to make it happen. Tools like ChatGPT or Gemini can help guide you through that process. As you build, you'll naturally come across areas where you need more knowledge, like math or algorithms. That’s when you can fill in those gaps, learning the theory as you go. This way, the theory feels more relevant because it's directly tied to what you're trying to achieve. While understanding the basics is important, applying them through building makes the learning process more meaningful and engaging."

I experimented with phones, launched YouTube channels focused on photography, and explored multiple creative interests like music, dance, and even badminton. Content creation wasn’t just a hobby—it was a passion that evolved over the years. However, the turning point came during my engineering days, particularly in my third year. I became actively involved in various tech communities and started attending numerous tech events. That exposure opened doors—many tech community founders and peers began sharing valuable resources, opportunities, and updates with me, trusting me to pass them along to fellow students. That’s when I realized: I had access to information that could truly help engineering students learn and grow. It felt like the perfect time to channel my passion for content into something impactful. I took up campus ambassador roles and began actively contributing to student communities. Slowly, my network grew across different states in India. I leveraged that reach to start building my personal brand—Tech Boy Deepak—focused on simplifying tech, upskilling, and sharing opportunities for students. Reaching 335,000+ followers and being honored as Mr. Influencer 2023 didn’t happen overnight. It’s been a journey of **consistent effort**—posting regularly, doing thorough research, and most importantly, **delivering real value** to my audience. Every piece of content I’ve shared reflects the hard work, authenticity, and passion I carry for helping the student community grow."

My goal is for viewers to remember the information, not just the presentation. Consistency is another key element. I’ve been showing up every day or every alternate day for over a year, and I genuinely believe that kind of discipline is what helps build a strong personal brand.

      "text": "I was always decent at math, topped my school and won multiple school and district-level Olympiads. But I also saw a stark contrast: many people around me were afraid of math. I always wondered, why do people hate such a beautiful subject? That question became clearer when I met Sudhanshu Bhatia, a world champion in mental math. He was easily 4-5x faster than me with numbers. Watching him made me realize an important pattern: those who are strong in basic mental math never struggle with the subject. The fear of math, in most cases, comes from weak fundamentals, if someone masters basic calculations, that fear just disappears. Our third co-founder, Sushant Timmapur, is also a national-level mental math champion. Sudhanshu and Sushant used to play number games just for fun and that playful, competitive spirit sparked the core idea behind Matiks: to make math fun through duels. Instead of treating math like a subject, we built a game that people love to play and one that strengthens their core abilities at the same time. The early feedback has been really encouraging. A few parents told us their kids now choose to play math games on Matiks instead of scrolling Instagram—that, for us, is the best validation."

I was good at art and music, but more than that, I enjoyed sketching, creating, and playing instruments. I never approached them with the pressure of exams or marks. That same mindset shapes how we design Matiks. People love to play games not because they’re told to, but because it’s fun and social. So we thought, why not turn math into that same kind of experience? We designed Matiks to give users the same dopamine hit they get from winning a game or solving a puzzle—except here, they’re also improving their mental aptitude. It’s not about forcing people to learn; it’s about creating something they want to play."

So we try to recreate that same energy in every game we build. Once the fun layer is nailed, we focus on **logic**: what exact skill are we sharpening? Is it basic calculations, number sense, or mental speed? And then finally, we build a smooth user experience around it so players stay in the flow. The goal is simple: to give users the same dopamine hit they get from any good game, while secretly improving their core math instincts."

What truly sets us apart is our focus on mental speed and confidence-building, rather than rote memorization. Users unknowingly improve their core calculation skills while enjoying the thrill of the game. But Matiks goes beyond math, it's becoming a social community.

I learned advanced math through YouTube and later went to Kota to prepare for IIT. There, I faced real competition and that’s when I met Sudhanshu. Through him, I came to know about things like abacus and how some people had trained in mental math from a very young age. I never learned abacus myself, but it opened my eyes to the kind of preparation others had. I just worked harder to compete with those who were already ahead of me in math. I pushed myself harder, surrounded myself with people who were better than me, and kept learning. I eventually secured a seat at IIT. Looking back, every milestone in my journey happened because of the people around me and my willingness to keep growing. Math was my escape, my strength, and my way forward."

I read about it and found out that it involves a lot of math. Since I was doing well in subjects like Mathematics, Physical Sciences, Economics, and Accounting, I thought to myself, I’ll study actuarial science at university. As I went through my studies at UCT, my understanding of the field deepened. Over time, I realised that quantitative finance had many applications beyond traditional actuarial work—especially in investment banking, trading, and derivatives pricing. My Master of Financial Engineering broadened my perspective even more by exposing me to advanced mathematical modelling in finance."

This was around the time when I was in 8th–10th grade. Past my 12th grade, I chose to do Electrical Engineering. It was tough, but I sailed through because I loved the subjects. I didn’t understand the content as much back then (everything makes sense now: the math, the equations, everything). I got a job in a production plant after my bachelor's. It was not what I thought I would be doing. I took a risk, quit the job, and started to prepare for entrance exams for a master’s degree. I got a chance to pick my major at the School of Information Science, Manipal. I had a choice between VLSI and Embedded. I picked Embedded because I felt programming CPUs would be so cool. Plus, I was willing to take the path of suffering again. Today, looking back, it is all worth it. I didn't understand how the world works, and EE accidentally enabled me!"

It took me years, and what seems to have worked for me is - **Round Robin**. Do a little bit of each, move on, and return when the interest spikes! Don't force yourself to master something too soon - it doesn't happen that way. Learn when you feel like it; that’s the only thing that really sticks anyway.

This impressed the seniors so much that I was promoted. I got three promotions in four years. All of this was because I spend time understanding and breaking down abstraction layers - in this case, I knew the layers between CPU, OS, and the application. Also, I try to reason from first principles. I can rely on my reasoning a lot more, and it's very hard to lose a debate if your arguments are based on facts of nature.

It’s like I managed to have an “adventure” response as opposed to a “fear” response. Another thing that helped me is giving my seniors some rights over me. I always tell my seniors they should call me out if I’m being an idiot, getting in the way, or bluffing. Also, I’m not too attached to the work I produce, code, documents, etc. , so if someone calls it bad or wants to throw it away, I’m completely okay with that. What happens because of that is people realize it’s easy to work with me and have hard conversations. And guess what? People naturally look out for those who are easy to work with!

If embedded interests you, focus on **building and understanding abstractions**. Program an Arduino and make something move - but also realize that someone has made the job easy for you. Try to look for what’s being hidden from you. In general, for embedded systems, do a round-robin between **C, CPUs (ARM-M, RISC-V), OS, and FPGAs**.

With an impressive career trajectory, Mr. Amogelang has successfully combined his expertise in actuarial science, risk management, and financial services, transforming the way businesses approach insurance and financial strategy across sectors. At just 30, he has already made his mark in the industry, having previously held the role of Chief Risk Officer at FNB at the age of 26. His leadership spans across diverse portfolios in Life, Short-term, and Microinsurance, as well as international operations, positioning him as one of the leading figures in South Africa’s actuarial and insurance landscape. In our conversation, we delved into a variety of topics, including the art of driving change within organizations, the balance between innovation and sustainable growth, and the critical importance of building the right foundations early in your career. Mr. Amogelang also shared valuable insights on adaptive leadership, emphasizing the need for emotional intelligence and a personalized approach to leading teams. He further explored the intersection of technology and employee engagement, highlighting how innovation can be leveraged to streamline operations while empowering teams to think outside the box.

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "First, fostering understanding and conviction. This means clearly articulating the \"why\" behind the change. A strong communication plan and a well-defined change story help ensure that employees understand the purpose of the transformation and align with the vision. Without this, there is no shared conviction, and change efforts lose momentum. Second, role modeling. Leaders must embody the behaviors they want to see in their teams. When employees see leadership demonstrating the desired changes, it builds credibility and reinforces expectations. This involves not only setting the tone but also spotlighting and recognizing the right behaviors across the organization. Third, reinforcing change through systems and processes. Too often, organizations attempt change while maintaining outdated processes that enable old behaviors. To drive real transformation, you need to switch off legacy systems, adjust key performance indicators, and redesign incentive structures to align with the new direction. When processes reinforce the change, it becomes ingrained in the organization’s culture. Finally, capability building. Change is only sustainable if employees have the skills and knowledge to support it. This means investing in training and development to equip teams with the necessary tools to navigate the transformation successfully. For leaders looking to apply this in their own journeys, the key is to be intentional. Communicate the vision clearly, lead by example, ensure structural alignment, and invest in people. Change is not just about strategy but about execution and culture, and these four pillars create the foundation for meaningful and lasting transformation."

      "text": "I don’t think managing innovation and managing sustainable long-term growth are mutually exclusive. In fact, I think you need a strong relationship between the two to ensure sustainable growth in an organization. If you fail to reinvent yourself over time, your business model will become redundant, which puts the sustainability of your earnings at risk over the long term. So, I think organizations need to see these two components as working together continuously. There is this concept of **creative destruction**. Apple is very good at this, where it's about disrupting your own internal business model. Even though it might hurt in the short term, it sets you up for success in the medium to long term. Take the example of the iPod vs. Apple Music. Apple had to disrupt itself by killing the iPod, but over the long term, the trend showed that streaming was going to be a major driver of growth. Similarly, as a business inside of Guardrisk, we continually scan the market and trends to determine where things are heading. We ensure that we implement the right business model shifts to capture long-term growth, even if it comes at the initial cost of an earnings dip or disrupting our existing business models. We are continuously monitoring for these changes. We require innovation and put mechanisms in place to ensure that staff members and colleagues can bring forward new, bright, and innovative ideas. Equally, we pride ourselves not just on selling a product but on truly solving underlying business problems. We structure solutions for clients, which naturally requires consistently thinking outside the box to address a particular problem or issue a client may have."

I’ve always believed in what they used to call a **\"T-shaped\" approach**, where you build deep expertise in certain areas while also gaining broad knowledge in others. You can’t know everything, but having a solid technical foundation and prioritizing its development is crucial. This approach challenges you, ensures continuous growth, and keeps you learning, even when it’s uncomfortable. Developing at a young age has been a key success factor for me. I’ve found that combining theoretical knowledge from my studies with practical experience is essential. Theoretical learning gives you the tools, but positioning yourself in the right roles and opportunities allows you to apply those tools effectively. I was reading a book the other day that talked about how skills are just one part of the equation, but context matters just as much. You can accumulate all these skill sets, but their true value depends on how and where you apply them. Ensuring that I have the right skills, gain hands-on experience, and apply them in the right context has been a fundamental part of my growth.

This approach requires a high level of self-awareness, understanding your own biases, triggers, and what drives and energizes you. But just as importantly, it demands strong observation skills because you need to understand the individuals you are working with, the industries you are operating in, and the different motivators and driving forces at play. When it comes to the industry itself, there is a technical component that requires learning and investing time in understanding the nuances of each sector. But when it comes to leading people, it is about adopting an adaptive leadership style, being able to observe, understand, and respond to the different driving and motivating factors of each team member. Rather than applying a broad, one-size-fits-all approach, it is about tailoring leadership to meet the specific needs of both the individuals and the organization. This, in turn, is driven by a high level of **emotional intelligence**, environmental awareness, and the ability to pick up on social cues and body language. It also means taking a genuine interest in your team members and ensuring that leadership is shaped by their unique needs and strengths."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Cultivating a growth mindset requires a reflective approach. When you take the time to reflect on your journey, you begin to see how much progress you have made over time. A book I read a few years ago, *Factfulness*, talks about how humans have a natural tendency to view the past more positively than the present. But if you look at human history objectively, you will see that things have consistently improved: poverty rates have declined, literacy rates have increased, and human development has advanced significantly. However, because the media tends to focus on negativity, we often feel like the present is worse than the past. I believe the same applies to our personal lives. We have a natural tendency to overlook our own progress. If you take a moment to reflect, you will often realize that you are now living a reality that was once just a dream. Five or ten years ago, you may have aspired to be where you are today. Recognizing that **growth is a continuous journey** is a key component of developing a strong mindset. The second aspect is making sure that, in every experience, whether it is a challenge or a success, you take time to extract the lessons from it. I believe that every trial and setback carries valuable lessons, and learning from those moments positions you for even greater success. If you view every experience as an opportunity to grow and understand that consistent effort over time leads to improvement, you will approach challenges with more positivity and less anxiety. The patterns show that when you put in the right work, stay consistent, learn from mistakes, and apply those lessons, you will ultimately reach your goals. These principles have helped me cultivate a strong growth mindset and optimism for the future. I always say that I get excited about what lies ahead because, looking at what I have achieved so far, I know there is still so much more to come. I have only worked a fraction of my career, and if past trends are any indication of the future, then that future holds exponential growth. Too often, people get bogged down by immediate setbacks and lose sight of the bigger picture. Maintaining perspective and focusing on long-term progress is what makes the difference."

The first is identifying existing pain points within my work and understanding how they align with the broader organizational strategy. Once I have thought through that, the next step is mapping out key technological elements that can be embedded to address those challenges. For example, if scalability and automation are crucial enablers but also pain points, the focus shifts to identifying the right technology and process improvements that can enhance scalability, enable automation, and eliminate repetitive tasks. This ensures that **employees are engaged in high-value activities** that fully utilize their skills and expertise. I believe these two aspects, technology integration and employee engagement, are not mutually exclusive but are instead deeply interconnected. By integrating technology effectively, you create room in your processes for team members to focus on high-quality, insightful, and engaging work. The second perspective is about thinking beyond current limitations and exploring the realm of possibilities. This requires setting a clear vision, dreaming big and asking, if you had a blank canvas, where would you position your organization or team? From that vision, you can then determine the role technology would play in achieving it. I separate these two approaches because the first is primarily about **operational efficiency**, ensuring that day-to-day processes run smoothly. The second is about leveraging new tools and technologies to drive **innovation**, develop creative solutions, and rethink traditional processes beyond the current scope of operations."

      "text": "The most important lesson I have learned about empowering others is the value of **building trust** within a team. Trust is the foundation that enables people to take risks, grow, and reach their full potential. There are three key elements to fostering that trust. First, technical grounding. As a leader, you need to have a solid technical foundation so that you can effectively coach and guide your team. When people see that you understand the work, they are more likely to trust your insights and leadership. Second, exposure and challenge. You have to be willing to push your team outside their comfort zones. Growth happens when people are given opportunities to stretch themselves, even if it means being thrown into the deep end. However, this must be balanced with **psychological safety**. People should feel secure enough to take risks and make mistakes without fear of excessive retribution. When mistakes are seen as learning opportunities rather than failures, real development happens. Third, effective feedback. Empowering others means giving feedback that is actionable, constructive, and geared toward growth. The goal is to create a cycle of risk-taking, learning, and continuous improvement. When people know they can take chances, receive guidance, and improve, they become more confident and capable. Ultimately, empowering a team is about creating an environment where people feel supported yet challenged. It should be a space where they are encouraged to experiment, fail, learn, and succeed. That balance is what leads to long-term growth, both individually and collectively."

      "text": "True investment diversification demands strategic asset selection because genuine diversification requires **uncorrelated assets**. The selected investments need to have varied responses to market shifts to minimise total investment risk. Successful portfolio diversification requires investors to match their asset allocation choices with their specific risk tolerance levels alongside their investment goals and time frames. Personal risk tolerance requires an in-depth evaluation of financial ability to handle losses and emotional resilience to market volatility. Individuals pursue diverse investment goals such as retirement savings, educational funding, and wealth accumulation for future opportunities. The duration of investment time horizons plays a crucial role in asset selection since longer time frames enable investors to allocate more capital to higher-risk investments such as stocks. Achieving effective portfolio management requires a strategic balance among various asset classes including equities, fixed income securities, alternative investments and cash holdings. Equities provide opportunities for higher returns, but they also bring about greater market volatility. Fixed income investments produce regular income streams and offer stability while delivering lower returns than other asset classes. Real estate and commodities as alternative assets function as protective tools against inflation and market declines and cash reserves provide essential liquidity for quick access to resources or investment opportunities. Investors need to maintain their portfolio balance through changing market cycles because asset reallocation based on economic shifts can stabilise returns and diminish risks. Investors must consistently update their portfolios to stay on track with their objectives while validating that their diversification plan remains effective in changing market conditions. "

      "text": "Understanding psychological principles is essential for improving financial decision-making. Investors often rely on their emotions rather than rational thought to make decisions. Numerous investors succumb to multiple **cognitive biases**, which seriously skew their decision-making abilities and result in financially poor choices. The most common cognitive bias in investment decisions is **overconfidence**, which causes people to judge their understanding of market trends incorrectly as superior. Investors may engage in excessive trading while ignoring vital market indicators because of their behaviour. The tendency to avoid losses more than acquiring gains makes investors reluctant to sell losing stocks until they break even instead of realising the loss and transferring funds to better opportunities. **Herd mentality** describes the behaviour of people copying others instead of making decisions through their analysis. The dot-com bubble and housing market crisis demonstrate how market bubbles emerge when investors follow rising trends without analysing the real worth of their investments. When investors become aware of cognitive biases, they can enhance their capacity to make smart and well-informed financial choices. Self-awareness helps investors maintain discipline, especially when markets are unstable, enabling them to avoid impulsive reactions to market changes. Investors who develop long-term perspectives maintain their dedication to financial goals while building stronger resistance to market pressures. Sound investment strategies that incorporate psychological insights result in better decision-making and enable long-term sustainable growth. "

Business founders should grasp how **debt financing differs from equity financing**. The necessity to repay debt along with interest impacts cash flow while equity financing requires selling parts of ownership which reduces control but eliminates the need for immediate payments. Maintaining business health relies heavily on practicing proper financial discipline. Businesses must track performance metrics and adhere to their budget plans while implementing essential changes when needed.
