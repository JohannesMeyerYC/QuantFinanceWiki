It shows the relationship between something you want to predict, like a stock price, and one or more independent variables, such as a market index or interest rates. Its biggest perks are its simplicity and how easy it is to understand. The model's coefficients give you a clear, transparent view of how each factor influences the outcome, which is super helpful when you need to explain decisions to stakeholders and regulators.\n\nBut here is the catch: financial markets are rarely simple or linear. Linear regression's assumptions often get violated by real-world financial data. That data is noisy, non-linear, and often has variables that are highly correlated. To fix these issues, we use regularization techniques like **Ridge and Lasso regression**.\n\n* **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization):** This adds a penalty that discourages the model's coefficients from getting too big. This helps prevent **overfitting**, which is when the model learns the noise instead of the real signal. It also stabilizes the model when features are correlated.\n* **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization):** This also adds a penalty but has a cool ability to shrink some coefficients all the way to zero. This basically does automatic **feature selection**, giving you a simpler, more understandable model that only uses the most important predictors.\n\nChoosing between simple linear regression and its regularized versions means weighing interpretability against predictive power. While linear regression is transparent, the complexity of modern markets often calls for the robustness of Ridge and Lasso, even if it makes the model a little less straightforward to understand."

Each node in the tree is a decision based on a feature, and each branch is the result of that decision. They are easy to visualize and can pick up on **non-linear relationships** without needing complex data transformations. However, a single decision tree is very likely to overfit. It can get too complex and essentially memorize the training data, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data.\n\n**Random Forests** fix this problem using an **ensemble technique**. Instead of building one tree, a Random Forest builds hundreds or even thousands of them. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and only considers a random subset of features for each split. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all the individual trees. This \"wisdom of the crowd\" approach dramatically reduces overfitting, boosts accuracy, and improves the model's ability to work well with new market conditions. While one tree is easy to interpret, a forest of trees is less so. That is a common trade-off for better performance."

They build trees one after the other, with each new tree designed to fix the errors of the previous ones. This iterative process lets the model focus on the instances that are hardest to predict, steadily improving its accuracy.\n\n* **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):** This is a highly efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting. It is known for its speed and performance and includes built-in regularization to prevent overfitting.\n* **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine):** Another optimized framework designed for even more speed and efficiency, especially with very large datasets. It uses a different tree growth strategy that makes it faster and uses less memory.\n\nGBMs consistently achieve top-tier performance in financial prediction tasks, from generating trading signals to modeling default probability. Their dominance shows the industry's focus on predictive accuracy and computational speed. However, their power and complexity make them **\"black boxes,\"** meaning their decision-making process is not clear.

Even with all the fancy new models popping up, Logistic Regression is still a benchmark in finance, especially for credit risk modeling. Its main benefit is how **easy it is to understand**. The model's coefficients clearly show how each input variable affects the outcome, which makes it simple to explain decisions to regulators and risk managers.

Maximizing this margin makes the model robust and helps it perform well on new data.\n\nA key trick with SVMs is the **\"kernel trick.\"** This lets them model complex, non-linear relationships. By mapping the data into a higher dimensional space, SVMs can find a linear separation that just would not be possible in the original space. They work well in high-dimensional spaces and can even perform nicely with limited training data, which is useful when you are modeling rare financial events.

K-Means is computationally efficient and lets financial institutions find natural groupings in their data.

Through this competitive process, the Generator gets better at creating realistic data.  \n\nIn finance, GANs are used to tackle the problem of **data scarcity**. Historical data for rare but critical events, like market crashes, is limited. GANs can generate huge amounts of **realistic synthetic data** that captures the statistical properties of real market behavior. This synthetic data can be used to beef up training sets for other ML models, stress test trading strategies against a wider range of market scenarios, and make risk models more robust without putting real client data privacy at risk."

Instead of just predicting what a stock price will be, an RL agent learns the best strategy for acting in the market through trial and error. The agent, which is basically a trading bot, interacts with the environment (the market) by taking actions like buying, selling, or holding. It gets rewards for profits and penalties for losses. Over millions of simulated trades, it learns a policy that maximizes its long-term total reward. RL is perfect for dynamic optimization problems like **trade execution**, which is finding the best way to execute a large order to minimize market impact, and **portfolio management**, which means dynamically rebalancing assets. It makes it possible to create truly adaptive trading systems that can learn and evolve with changing market conditions."

This gives you a much more realistic estimate of a model's future performance. It is also crucial to avoid **data snooping**. This happens when the same data is used repeatedly to pick models and fine-tune parameters, leading to overfitting and results that look artificially good.

That old idea of corporate security is being challenged by a pretty provocative thought: **\"As an entrepreneur you are more likely to use AI; as a corporate employee you are more likely to be used or replaced by AI.\"**\n\nThis idea completely flips the script on what \"risk\" even means. Those high-paying, brainy jobs that used to be the gold standard of corporate safety are now prime targets for **automation**.

So, while the corporate world is still a crucial place for developing talent and offers a ton of stability, the tide is definitely turning. Modern professionals are increasingly drawn to the freedom, purpose, and tech power that entrepreneurship offers.

A Finnish student named **Linus Torvalds** first created it back in 1991. The kernel is the master conductor of your computer’s orchestra. It talks to your hardware (like your CPU, memory, and storage), manages all the programs you are running, and makes sure everything works together smoothly. It is the unsung hero making your digital life possible. \n\nNow, how do you tell this powerful kernel what you want it to do? That is where the **shell** comes in. The shell is your command line interpreter. It is your direct line to the operating system, often seen as that \"terminal window\" where you type commands. While graphical interfaces are great for many tasks, the shell gives you incredible power and precision. It is like having a direct conversation with your computer."

It is pretty user-friendly, packed with features like command history (so you do not have to retype everything) and tab completion (a fantastic time saver that auto completes commands and filenames).\n* **Zsh** (Z Shell): Think of Zsh as Bash’s cool, highly customizable cousin. Zsh is a favorite among developers and power users because it offers even more advanced features, like smarter auto-correction for typos and amazing plugin support (you might hear about \"Oh My Zsh\" which makes it even cooler).\n\nDo not let the command line scare you. It is a skill, and like any skill, it just takes a bit of practice. Once you get the hang of it, you will unlock a new level of control and efficiency. It is actually quite satisfying."

But what if you need to install new software or change an important system setting? That is where **sudo** comes in.\n\nsudo stands for **\"superuser do\"** (or sometimes \"substitute user do\"). It is a brilliant command that lets a permitted regular user execute a single command with root privileges. You type `sudo` before the command you want to run, and the system will ask for your password (not the root password) to confirm you are allowed to do it. This is much safer than logging in as the root user all the time because it limits how often those all-powerful privileges are used. It is like having a special key that only works for one specific door, just one time. Some versions of Linux, like Ubuntu, really emphasize using sudo and even disable direct root login by default for extra safety. Smart."

But it is one thing to write a proof of concept or have simulations running on a server in the back of a university room. It is very different to have thousands of people relying on your software and expecting it to work all of the time. To do that right, you need a series of things: security and privacy reviews, load tests, metrics, logs, dashboards, automated alarms, runbooks for emergencies, and rollback mechanisms. You need someone on-call at all times.\n\nThe first time I was **on-call for big tech**, I got paged at 2 am and had to stay up until about 4 mitigating an issue. That was when I realized things got real. Getting used to that can take some time, and can also be scary and stressful at first."

Resist that urge and take your time to go through all the training, to build as solid a foundation as you can in the internal tech stack. And do **ask for help when in need**. It is best to ping someone (or even page them if it is an emergency) when you are stuck than to waste time trying to figure everything out yourself."

Focus on the problem you are trying to solve, and make sure you understand it before jumping to a solution. If you do not, everything will fall apart.\n\nLet me expand a little bit here: a “problem” can be a coding question, a system design question, or even a question in a behavioural interview. I have seen multiple experienced people fail behavioural interviews because they did a poor job at answering what was asked, digressing into tales full of irrelevant technical details instead. **Know what you are solving**."

With the current tendency of people using AI to generate code, sometimes even non-technical people, the attack surface is going to increase to unseen levels. I expect the demand for security professionals to increase one way or another: either because companies are building faster and need more security experts to keep shipping as safely as possible, or because they will suffer losses from security breaches and will be forced to hire security teams."

When it comes to building large-scale systems, there are often many moving pieces to deliver the required functionality while addressing non-functional requirements.\n\nIt gets trickier the larger the system has to be: trade-offs come in like availability vs consistency, performance vs maintainability, and cost. If you get the problem wrong, i.e., you are addressing the wrong requirements, chances are you will make bad trade-off decisions and build the wrong thing. Is eventual consistency acceptable? Do we need read-after-write consistency? How long can a search query take for it to still be useful to customers? How long after the write should the data be consistently available? What are the availability expectations? Should failed tasks be re-processed? Do they ever become irrelevant? This kind of question will help shape the system architecture."

      "text": "Let us talk money: quant roles are famous for their hefty paychecks. It is not unusual for undergraduates to step into positions with total compensation packages ranging from **$100,000 all the way up to $400,000** or even more. For those with several years under their belt, earnings can climb into the upper six figures and even cross the seven-figure mark. For instance, the average salary for quant traders was reported around **$95,386** as of early 2025, with a significant range depending on the firm and experience, while quantitative analysts might see a median total pay around **$253,000** in 2024. Bonuses can be substantial, with some top firms offering new graduates first-year guarantees exceeding **$500,000**.\n\nBeyond the impressive salaries, the **intellectual stimulation** is a major draw. Quant work is a playground for the academically inclined, requiring a diverse toolkit drawing from statistics, mathematics, computer science, data science, and machine learning. The job is often compared to academia in its research aspects; quants are constantly trying to develop new strategies or refine existing ones, a task that places a high value on **creativity**. It is a field where you are paid to solve complex, intellectually stimulating problems using advanced mathematical and statistical techniques. The environment is dynamic, always demanding innovative thinking to find new profitable opportunities in ever-changing markets.\n\nMany also appreciate a culture that often feels closer to the tech world than traditional finance. This can mean more relaxed teams, less bureaucracy, and perks like free food, good benefits, and fitness incentives, mirroring those found in leading tech companies. For some, this environment is significantly less stressful than what they might have experienced in a traditional banking setting. Furthermore, quants can have a **direct and tangible impact** on financial markets and the investment decisions of major organizations. The high demand for these skills also translates into opportunities for **rapid career advancement** for those who excel."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "However, the path of a quant is not without its thorns. The high rewards often come with **high pressure**. Trading, a common quant activity, is a domain where a single bad decision can lead to losses in the tens of thousands of dollars, meaning you need to be sharp and focused all the time. Forget about coasting on a Friday if you are feeling a bit worse for wear; the market waits for no one.\n\nSchedules tend to be inflexible, taking a day off is not a simple affair, and for traders, working from home is practically unheard of. The field, particularly trading, is also known for being very young, with a median age often appearing to be **under 30**. This is not necessarily a negative in itself, but it can point to a potential lack of long-term sustainability in certain high-stress roles. The intensity and constant performance expectations lead many older traders to look for less demanding positions, perhaps in quant research.\n\nMany firms foster a **\"make it or break it\"** atmosphere: perform well, and you will be compensated handsomely; fail to meet expectations, and you could be out the door. In a way, those high salaries are partly compensating for the career risk you are shouldering. A crucial trait for survival is being **comfortable with failure**. The financial markets are incredibly dynamic, and even the most brilliant, seemingly foolproof ideas can fall flat. Aspiring quants must be able to detach from a failing concept and quickly pivot to new models and ideas, rather than stubbornly trying to make a broken strategy work.\n\nThe environment can be intense and aggressive, demanding an ability to thrive under pressure, maintain unwavering focus during long hours, and stomach setbacks. And, of course, the **competition is fierce**. The allure of big salaries and intellectual challenges draws many candidates, making it tough to land a role, especially at top-tier funds and investment banks. The very nature of the work, while intellectually stimulating for many, can also be perceived as abstract and narrow. Unlike fundamental analysts who might read annual reports, meet company management, or talk to shareholders, quants spend most of their time immersed in computer code and numbers on a screen. For individuals with broader interests or a desire for management roles involving more interpersonal interaction, this intense focus might not be the ideal fit. Some PhDs transitioning from academia find they miss the deep, extended research environment, as the pace of a trading desk often demands solutions in days or hours, precluding major theoretical breakthroughs."

This is the first step to finding relevant **practical AI applications**.\n* **Look for Proven, Single-Purpose Tools (Initially):** While all-in-one platforms are emerging, often the best AI tools excel at one thing. Otter is for transcription. Grammarly is for writing. Master these before getting overwhelmed.\n* **Prioritize a Shallow Learning Curve:** If an AI tool takes you days to learn, it is defeating the purpose of saving time, at least initially. Look for intuitive interfaces.\n* **Does it Actually Integrate with Your Workflow?** A fancy AI tool is useless if it does not play well with how you already work or if it adds more steps than it removes.\n* **Test with Real Work, Ruthlessly:** Use free trials. Throw your actual Young & Calculated tasks at them. If an **AI tool for productivity** does not deliver tangible time savings or quality improvement within that trial, ditch it. No FOMO.\n* **Do not Chase Every New AI Shiny Object:** The AI space is moving at lightning speed. It is tempting to try everything. Resist.

It marked the start of a new world order that would dramatically change financial markets, globalization, and international trade.

This includes aspects such as employment, industry, the value of a nation’s production (GDP), and the well-being of society. **Financial markets** refer specifically to the systems where people and organizations exchange money, make investments, and gain access to capital.

Finally, I look at the long-term effects of the Cold War, specifically post-USSR globalization and economic shifts. By looking at all of this, a clear picture is formed of the impact the Cold War had on these volatile sectors."

This was not a coincidence but a strategic decision that followed the **NSC-68 policy**, which became the foundation of America's international policy during that period. This was a classified policy document written in 1950 by the US National Security Council. It focused on how to deal with the Soviet Union and the communist threat, which was a major source of tension in capitalist politics at the time. [Office of the Historian (n.d.)]"

The US and the USSR each formed separate economic spheres, resulting in limited trade between the two and a redistribution of trade partners around the world. In the early years of the Cold War, the United States followed a policy of international economic cooperation, which led to the establishment of institutions like the **International Monetary Fund (IMF)** and the **World Bank**. These institutions not only supported Europe's economic recovery after World War II but also promoted global trade by encouraging stability and cooperation. [Campos, R. G., Heid, B., & Timini, J.

The Soviet Union focused on self-sufficiency and mostly traded with countries within its own economic sphere, such as Eastern Europe and Cuba. This approach resulted in a lack of competition, which ultimately contributed to the Soviet Union's economic stagnation. The limited trade between the two powers did not only affect their own economies but also reshaped global trade patterns. Countries not aligned with either bloc often struggled to form trade partnerships due to pressure to pick a side. This situation gave rise to the **\"non-aligned movement,\"** a group of countries that aimed to maintain a neutral position in global politics. [Campos, R. G., Heid, B., & Timini, J. (2024)]"

They also played an active role in shaping global power structures and spreading economic ideologies. The interaction between geopolitical tension, military spending, and financial markets created a dynamic and often unpredictable environment that forced investors, governments, and international institutions to think strategically and respond quickly to volatility. [Markets in War Time (2022)]\n\nIn 1944, the **Bretton Woods system** established a new international monetary framework that confirmed the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. This system fixed the exchange rate between the dollar and gold, which promoted stability in international financial markets. However, by the late 1960s, growing US budget deficits, particularly due to the cost of the Vietnam War, put pressure on the dollar. In 1971, President Richard Nixon announced the **\"Nixon Shock,\"** which removed the dollar from the gold standard and marked the beginning of the end of the Bretton Woods system. Massive US military spending not only affected the national budget but also had a direct impact on financial markets. The increased demand for resources caused inflation, which forced investors to adjust to a new economic reality. The 1970s were marked by a period of **\"stagflation\"**, a mix of economic stagnation and high inflation, which weakened the stability of financial markets. [Markets in War Time (2022)]"

In Russia, the ruble experienced significant devaluation, leading to an inflation rate of **84% in 1998**. Shock therapy in Russia, however, led to a concentration of wealth among a small elite often referred to as “oligarchs.” The lack of proper regulatory frameworks made the transition challenging, resulting in economic instability and the rise of corruption. The financial sector went through major changes. Many Russian banks struggled to survive, and some collapsed during the **1998 financial crisis**.\n\nHowever, international banks like Deutsche Bank took advantage of the situation and acquired others such as Bankers Trust. This increased Russia’s integration into the global financial system. Despite early challenges, some former Soviet states like Poland experienced successful economic reforms. Poland’s shock therapy approach led to lower inflation and reduced budget deficits, laying the groundwork for rapid economic growth. In contrast, Russia pushed for fast private-sector reform without sufficient regulation, resulting in an economy with less inclusive growth. Over the past decade, former Soviet countries have increasingly focused on strengthening financial regulation and integrating their markets into the global economy. The European Union, for example, introduced reforms aimed at deepening markets and encouraging long-term investment. These efforts have helped improve financial stability in the region.

The West prioritized free markets and capitalism, while many were surprised when the USSR, despite its socialist principles, developed a massive military-industrial complex. The economic pressure of the Cold War contributed significantly to the ethical dilemmas of the era. At first, both superpowers justified their military spending as necessary for national security, but as the real cost of arms production and the space race became evident, it raised serious questions about priorities.\n\nThe USA eventually saw how its own financial system was disrupted by war spending, while the USSR realized that its centralized economy could not keep up. Ultimately, the economic struggle forced both sides to act against their original principles: the USA by accepting state intervention in the market, and the USSR by allowing limited market reforms. In the end, both had to acknowledge that their actions, while sometimes contradictory to their ideologies, were seen as necessary in the context of the broader conflict."

Massive military spending led to **technological innovation** in the USA, such as the development of the internet and satellite communication, while in the USSR, a centrally planned economy worsened economic stagnation. The conflict split international trade into two distinct spheres, with the USA promoting globalisation through institutions like the IMF, and the USSR maintaining its own trade network. Financial markets became more volatile, especially after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, which triggered stagflation and new approaches to monetary policy. After the fall of the USSR in 1991, rapid globalisation accelerated, but also led to economic inequality and corruption in several post-Soviet states. The legacy of the Cold War shows how political competition can shape economic systems, with long-term effects still visible today in areas like technology, trade, and financial stability."

I believe there is great wisdom in this aphorism once you understand that a model is just a simple(r) mathematical representation of a real-world phenomenon. Regarding its application to real-world settings would therefore first involve surveying and exploring the data – let the data tell its story first, before selecting any appropriate modelling technique. Once you have played “data detective” to a sufficient degree in coaching out the secrets of a dataset, only then can one feasibly start experimenting with various modelling techniques (assuming that we would like to predict some phenomenon – there are other use-cases of machine learning as well, keep in mind).\n\nNaturally, the greatest challenge lies in **data quality**; most datasets are extremely messy and unordered and full of errors, which is a big challenge to any data science project. Why? Well, reality itself is typically chaotic, which partly explains messy data. And measurement devices or whatever data collection device/software/architecture you are using can and will fail over time, or become uncalibrated/outdated/misapplied, which leads to data errors.

      "text": "Remember that statistical learning is an applied science. Arguing between theoretical models and applied models is a foolish endeavour, at least when predicting some phenomenon from data. For example, applying a particular modelling technique (such as **binary logistic regression**) would involve calibrating it to a given training dataset, just like teaching a toddler how to behave from some parenting book and personal experience. The method by which such a model is trained (maximum likelihood estimation in this case) is both theoretically derived and already practically implemented within statistical software (such as R). There is no real divide, apart from some computational statistics-related adjustments (though even these are deeply embedded within the statistical software).\n\nNow of course, there exists some best practices to modelling something, which is why data science is also a craft (not only a science). But even these practices depend heavily on the setting and context. It is not as simple as just calibrating a technique since calibration itself may fail in certain circumstances. In this case, nothing beats a comparative study of many techniques whilst tuning some parameters and experimenting with different variables and transformations; in short, **curiosity**."

All this whilst actively publishing in internationally-acclaimed scientific journals, where each article/paper is about equivalent to the work of one Masters degree. These days, I am also supervising postgraduate students at the BSc Hons, MSc, and PhD-levels. How do I balance all of this? By maintaining a healthy lifestyle with dedicated time slots to each endeavor and following a **strict discipline with my time schedule** in all areas. I try not to waste any minute in a typical workday, though ensure that (most of) my weekends are free for relaxation, thereby unwinding from an otherwise strict schedule. Of course, being passionate about one’s work also helps, while also deciding to forego having children. My students and published works would be my legacy, by personal choice."

Spending time in formulating the right set of questions is very important; the famous physicist Prof. Richard Feynman once said that just **formulating the question is about 50% of the work**. Once formulated, one can proceed with proposing a solution, which involves conducting a brief literature study in discovering what has been done by other scientists in the past on related questions. A proposal document typically spells out the research problem, gives background information, proposes a possible solution(s), outlines the approach to applying the solution (e.g., specifying the required data), and posits some wider implications of the work (i.e., why should we care?). Once the proposal is accepted by whichever interested party, then the research project can start in all earnest; typically by conducting a full-length literature review before touching any data. Afterwards, the data collection/exploration and subsequent modelling phase starts, all while writing up the usual parts of a typical research report/dissertation (Introduction, Background/literature study, Method, Calibration & Results, Conclusion, Appendices). This process typically culminates in a closeout presentation during which the final results are shared and the research question ideally answered conclusively, as accompanied by the research report. If you follow this roadmap, then you should be fine with any research project. "

      "text": "Over the years, I have seen a significant evolution in the qualifications and skill sets that top financial firms seek. Traditionally, professional designations like **CA(SA), CFA, and Actuarial Sciences** were highly valued, but today they have become more multifaceted. These qualifications now reflect a broader understanding of business and a deep understanding of financial concepts, rather than just being narrowly focused on one dimension.\n\nIn today’s ever-changing corporate world, where teams are leaner and corporate structures tend to be flatter, candidates are expected to bring more to the table than just the prestige of holding a certain title. Financial firms now increasingly look for individuals who can offer a combination of technical expertise, strategic thinking, and **adaptability**. While qualifications like Chartered Accountant, CFA Charterholder, or Actuary remain important, there’s a growing emphasis on skills like **data analysis, coding, and proficiency with AI and machine learning tools**. These competencies are now seen as essential for staying ahead in a rapidly digitising landscape. Additionally, companies are prioritising candidates who demonstrate a strong understanding of global market trends, regulatory changes, and **environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors**.\n\nEmotional intelligence, leadership in collaborative settings, and the ability to manage change are also key attributes that financial firms are increasingly valuing. An excerpt which I always find apt: According to Douglas Hall, an individual with a **protean career** is one who actively and constantly updates their career pathway in order to remain relevant to their work environment (Hall, 2004). The word “protean” came from “Proteus”, a Greek god with the ability to constantly change his shape in response to the environment he was in. Thus, Proteus signifies someone who is **flexible, versatile and highly adaptable**. In career development-speak, an individual with a protean career is characterised by continuous a state of continuous self-assessment, self-direction, and self-development. Due to this individual’s flexibility, they are able to pursue different opportunities whenever it presents itself, explore new industries, and constantly redefine the meaning of success on their own terms, but in relation to the changing work environment. To be ‘protean’ means to adopt an attitude that provides the individual with all the abovementioned level of flexibility and versatility."

These interests often give insight into their **critical thinking, passion for the industry, and long-term growth mindset**. For example, a candidate who actively follows global economic trends, reads thought-provoking books or publications, and enjoys discussing current shifts in technology or finance, tends to bring a broader perspective to problem-solving and innovation. Similarly, someone who is involved in hobbies, whether it is endurance sports, travel, volunteering, or creative pursuits, often demonstrates **resilience, cultural awareness**, and the ability to balance diverse interests. These seemingly ‘non-professional’ traits give a fuller picture of who the person is and often highlight qualities like resilience, cultural awareness, and the ability to connect with others, traits that are increasingly important in collaborative and fast-paced environments."

I named it **Study Buddy**. It is a simple-to-use tool that gives clear explanations, answers questions, and helps kids organize their study notes. I designed it with safety in mind, by using strict content filters and creating a persona that keeps interactions focused and educational. The app allows kids to ask questions about text or images and store their study notes all in one place. You can find the code for it here: Study Buddy GitHub Repo. "

For example, if you want to create an iOS app but do not know where to begin, focus on what kind of app you want, its functionality and design, first. Then, **reverse-engineer the learning process** by figuring out what skills and knowledge you need to make it happen. Tools like ChatGPT or Gemini can help guide you through that process.\n\nAs you build, you will naturally come across areas where you need more knowledge, like math or algorithms. That is when you can fill in those gaps, learning the theory as you go. This way, the theory feels more relevant because it is directly tied to what you are trying to achieve. While understanding the basics is important, applying them through building makes the learning process more meaningful and engaging."

I always wondered, why do people hate such a beautiful subject? That question became clearer when I met Sudhanshu Bhatia, a world champion in mental math. He was easily 4-5x faster than me with numbers. Watching him made me realize an important pattern: those who are strong in basic mental math never struggle with the subject. The **fear of math**, in most cases, comes from **weak fundamentals**; if someone masters basic calculations, that fear just disappears.\n\nOur third co-founder, Sushant Timmapur, is also a national-level mental math champion. Sudhanshu and Sushant used to play number games just for fun and that playful, competitive spirit sparked the core idea behind **Matiks**: to make math fun through **duels**. Instead of treating math like a subject, we built a game that people love to play and one that strengthens their core abilities at the same time. The early feedback has been really encouraging. A few parents told us their kids now choose to play math games on Matiks instead of scrolling Instagram, that, for us, is the best validation."

That same mindset shapes how we design Matiks. People love to play games not because they are told to, but because it is fun and social. So we thought, why not turn math into that same kind of experience? We designed Matiks to give users the same **dopamine hit** they get from winning a game or solving a puzzle, except here, they are also improving their mental aptitude.

So we try to recreate that same energy in every game we build. Once the fun layer is nailed, we focus on **logic**: what exact skill are we sharpening? Is it basic calculations, number sense, or mental speed? And then finally, we build a smooth **user experience** around it so players stay in the flow.

I learned advanced math through YouTube and later went to Kota to prepare for **IIT**. There, I faced real competition and that is when I met Sudhanshu. Through him, I came to know about things like abacus and how some people had trained in mental math from a very young age. I never learned abacus myself, but it opened my eyes to the kind of preparation others had. I just worked harder to compete with those who were already ahead of me in math. I pushed myself harder, surrounded myself with people who were better than me, and kept learning. I eventually secured a seat at IIT.

This was around the time when I was in 8th–10th grade. Past my 12th grade, I chose to do Electrical Engineering. It was tough, but I sailed through because I loved the subjects. I did not understand the content as much back then (everything makes sense now: the math, the equations, everything).\n\nI got a job in a production plant after my bachelor's. It was not what I thought I would be doing. I took a risk, quit the job, and started to prepare for entrance exams for a master’s degree. I got a chance to pick my major at the School of Information Science, Manipal. I had a choice between VLSI and Embedded. I picked Embedded because I felt programming CPUs would be so cool.

I always tell my seniors they should call me out if I am being an idiot, getting in the way, or bluffing. Also, I am not too attached to the work I produce, code, documents, etc. , so if someone calls it bad or wants to throw it away, I am completely okay with that.

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Driving successful change within an organization comes down to a structured framework that ensures alignment, execution, and reinforcement. One of the most effective models I have worked with is **McKinsey & Company's Influence Model**, which focuses on four key elements. \n\nFirst, fostering understanding and conviction. This means clearly articulating the \"why\" behind the change. A strong communication plan and a well-defined change story help ensure that employees understand the purpose of the transformation and align with the vision. Without this, there is no shared conviction, and change efforts lose momentum. Second, role modeling. Leaders must embody the behaviors they want to see in their teams. When employees see leadership demonstrating the desired changes, it builds credibility and reinforces expectations. This involves not only setting the tone but also spotlighting and recognizing the right behaviors across the organization. Third, reinforcing change through systems and processes. Too often, organizations attempt change while maintaining outdated processes that enable old behaviors. To drive real transformation, you need to switch off legacy systems, adjust key performance indicators, and redesign incentive structures to align with the new direction. When processes reinforce the change, it becomes ingrained in the organization’s culture. Finally, capability building. Change is only sustainable if employees have the skills and knowledge to support it. This means investing in training and development to equip teams with the necessary tools to navigate the transformation successfully. For leaders looking to apply this in their own journeys, the key is to be intentional. Communicate the vision clearly, lead by example, ensure structural alignment, and invest in people. Change is not just about strategy but about execution and culture, and these four pillars create the foundation for meaningful and lasting transformation."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "I do not think managing innovation and managing sustainable long-term growth are mutually exclusive. In fact, I think you need a strong relationship between the two to ensure sustainable growth in an organization. If you fail to reinvent yourself over time, your business model will become redundant, which puts the sustainability of your earnings at risk over the long term. So, I think organizations need to see these two components as working together continuously. There is this concept of **creative destruction**. Apple is very good at this, where it is about disrupting your own internal business model. Even though it might hurt in the short term, it sets you up for success in the medium to long term. Take the example of the iPod vs. Apple Music. Apple had to disrupt itself by killing the iPod, but over the long term, the trend showed that streaming was going to be a major driver of growth.\n\nSimilarly, as a business inside of Guardrisk, we continually scan the market and trends to determine where things are heading. We ensure that we implement the right business model shifts to capture long-term growth, even if it comes at the initial cost of an earnings dip or disrupting our existing business models. We are continuously monitoring for these changes. We require innovation and put mechanisms in place to ensure that staff members and colleagues can bring forward new, bright, and innovative ideas. Equally, we pride ourselves not just on selling a product but on truly solving underlying business problems. We structure solutions for clients, which naturally requires consistently thinking outside the box to address a particular problem or issue a client may have."

It is about getting the right exposure and developing strong technical expertise. I have always believed in what they used to call a **\"T-shaped\" approach**, where you build deep expertise in certain areas while also gaining broad knowledge in others. You cannot know everything, but having a solid technical foundation and prioritizing its development is crucial. This approach challenges you, ensures continuous growth, and keeps you learning, even when it is uncomfortable. Developing at a young age has been a key success factor for me. I have found that combining theoretical knowledge from my studies with practical experience is essential. Theoretical learning gives you the tools, but positioning yourself in the right roles and opportunities allows you to apply those tools effectively. I was reading a book the other day that talked about how skills are just one part of the equation, but context matters just as much. You can accumulate all these skill sets, but their true value depends on how and where you apply them. Ensuring that I have the right skills, gain hands-on experience, and apply them in the right context has been a fundamental part of my growth. "

This approach requires a high level of self-awareness, understanding your own biases, triggers, and what drives and energizes you. But just as importantly, it demands strong observation skills because you need to understand the individuals you are working with, the industries you are operating in, and the different motivators and driving forces at play. When it comes to the industry itself, there is a technical component that requires learning and investing time in understanding the nuances of each sector. But when it comes to leading people, it is about adopting an adaptive leadership style, being able to observe, understand, and respond to the different driving and motivating factors of each team member. Rather than applying a broad, one-size-fits-all approach, it is about tailoring leadership to meet the specific needs of both the individuals and the organization. This, in turn, is driven by a high level of **emotional intelligence**, environmental awareness, and the ability to pick up on social cues and body language. It also means taking a genuine interest in your team members and ensuring that leadership is shaped by their unique needs and strengths."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Cultivating a growth mindset requires a reflective approach. When you take the time to reflect on your journey, you begin to see how much progress you have made over time. A book I read a few years ago, *Factfulness*, talks about how humans have a natural tendency to view the past more positively than the present. But if you look at human history objectively, you will see that things have consistently improved: poverty rates have declined, literacy rates have increased, and human development has advanced significantly. However, because the media tends to focus on negativity, we often feel like the present is worse than the past.\n\nI believe the same applies to our personal lives. We have a natural tendency to overlook our own progress. If you take a moment to reflect, you will often realize that you are now living a reality that was once just a dream. Five or ten years ago, you may have aspired to be where you are today. Recognizing that **growth is a continuous journey** is a key component of developing a strong mindset. The second aspect is making sure that, in every experience, whether it is a challenge or a success, you take time to extract the lessons from it. I believe that every trial and setback carries valuable lessons, and learning from those moments positions you for even greater success. If you view every experience as an opportunity to grow and understand that consistent effort over time leads to improvement, you will approach challenges with more positivity and less anxiety. The patterns show that when you put in the right work, stay consistent, learn from mistakes, and apply those lessons, you will ultimately reach your goals. These principles have helped me cultivate a strong growth mindset and optimism for the future. I always say that I get excited about what lies ahead because, looking at what I have achieved so far, I know there is still so much more to come. I have only worked a fraction of my career, and if past trends are any indication of the future, then that future holds exponential growth. Too often, people get bogged down by immediate setbacks and lose sight of the bigger picture. Maintaining perspective and focusing on long-term progress is what makes the difference."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "My approach to integrating new technologies into my areas of work follows two key lenses. The first is identifying existing pain points within my work and understanding how they align with the broader organizational strategy. Once I have thought through that, the next step is mapping out key technological elements that can be embedded to address those challenges. For example, if scalability and automation are crucial enablers but also pain points, the focus shifts to identifying the right technology and process improvements that can enhance scalability, enable automation, and eliminate repetitive tasks. This ensures that **employees are engaged in high-value activities** that fully utilize their skills and expertise. I believe these two aspects, technology integration and employee engagement, are not mutually exclusive but are instead deeply interconnected. By integrating technology effectively, you create room in your processes for team members to focus on high-quality, insightful, and engaging work.\n\nThe second perspective is about thinking beyond current limitations and exploring the realm of possibilities. This requires setting a clear vision, dreaming big and asking, if you had a blank canvas, where would you position your organization or team? From that vision, you can then determine the role technology would play in achieving it. I separate these two approaches because the first is primarily about **operational efficiency**, ensuring that day-to-day processes run smoothly. The second is about leveraging new tools and technologies to drive **innovation**, develop creative solutions, and rethink traditional processes beyond the current scope of operations."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The most important lesson I have learned about empowering others is the value of **building trust** within a team. Trust is the foundation that enables people to take risks, grow, and reach their full potential. There are three key elements to fostering that trust. First, technical grounding. As a leader, you need to have a solid technical foundation so that you can effectively coach and guide your team. When people see that you understand the work, they are more likely to trust your insights and leadership. Second, exposure and challenge. You have to be willing to push your team outside their comfort zones. Growth happens when people are given opportunities to stretch themselves, even if it means being thrown into the deep end. However, this must be balanced with **psychological safety**. People should feel secure enough to take risks and make mistakes without fear of excessive retribution. When mistakes are seen as learning opportunities rather than failures, real development happens. Third, effective feedback. Empowering others means giving feedback that is actionable, constructive, and geared toward growth. The goal is to create a cycle of risk-taking, learning, and continuous improvement. When people know they can take chances, receive guidance, and improve, they become more confident and capable. Ultimately, empowering a team is about creating an environment where people feel supported yet challenged. It should be a space where they are encouraged to experiment, fail, learn, and succeed. That balance is what leads to long-term growth, both individually and collectively."

The actual practice of successful investing demands a multifaceted approach that combines disciplined strategies with meticulous decision-making. Investors need to develop **patience** to maintain their investment strategy throughout market fluctuations while simultaneously implementing risk management methods to safeguard their assets. New investors need to prioritise **long-term sustainable growth** rather than short-term performance. Investors need to define specific financial objectives and recognise that staying invested over time yields better results than trying to predict market movements. A durable investment strategy focuses on long-term wealth creation through diversified assets, constant investment inputs and the reinvestment of earned returns. Beginners who understand that investment growth occurs over extended periods ranging from years to decades can develop a deeper understanding of **compounding interest** and market trends. Investors who develop a long-term investment mindset achieve more consistent returns while also gaining increased confidence when facing market volatility."

      "text": "True investment diversification demands strategic asset selection because genuine diversification requires **uncorrelated assets**. The selected investments need to have varied responses to market shifts to minimise total investment risk. Successful portfolio diversification requires investors to match their asset allocation choices with their specific risk tolerance levels alongside their investment goals and time frames. Personal risk tolerance requires an in-depth evaluation of financial ability to handle losses and emotional resilience to market volatility. Individuals pursue diverse investment goals such as retirement savings, educational funding, and wealth accumulation for future opportunities. The duration of investment time horizons plays a crucial role in asset selection since longer time frames enable investors to allocate more capital to higher-risk investments such as stocks.\n\nAchieving effective portfolio management requires a strategic balance among various asset classes including equities, fixed income securities, alternative investments and cash holdings. Equities provide opportunities for higher returns, but they also bring about greater market volatility. Fixed income investments produce regular income streams and offer stability while delivering lower returns than other asset classes. Real estate and commodities as alternative assets function as protective tools against inflation and market declines and cash reserves provide essential liquidity for quick access to resources or investment opportunities. Investors need to maintain their portfolio balance through changing market cycles because asset reallocation based on economic shifts can stabilise returns and diminish risks. Investors must consistently update their portfolios to stay on track with their objectives while validating that their diversification plan remains effective in changing market conditions. "

They understand that ongoing changes define our world and prioritise flexibility as a key factor for their success. Their ability to adapt helps them shift their approach when encountering unexpected obstacles, which ensures they maintain effectiveness and relevance in their endeavours. Key habits distinguish successful people from others. Successful people define specific objectives that direct their actions while providing motivational momentum. They sustain accountability by self-evaluating or seeking guidance from mentors and peers, which ensures they are responsible for their personal development and achievements. Their character heavily relies on **resilience** as its fundamental attribute. They confront challenges head-on during tough times.

Numerous investors succumb to multiple **cognitive biases**, which seriously skew their decision-making abilities and result in financially poor choices. The most common cognitive bias in investment decisions is **overconfidence**, which causes people to judge their understanding of market trends incorrectly as superior. Investors may engage in excessive trading while ignoring vital market indicators because of their behaviour. The tendency to avoid losses more than acquiring gains makes investors reluctant to sell losing stocks until they break even instead of realising the loss and transferring funds to better opportunities. **Herd mentality** describes the behaviour of people copying others instead of making decisions through their analysis. The dot-com bubble and housing market crisis demonstrate how market bubbles emerge when investors follow rising trends without analysing the real worth of their investments. When investors become aware of cognitive biases, they can enhance their capacity to make smart and well-informed financial choices. Self-awareness helps investors maintain discipline, especially when markets are unstable, enabling them to avoid impulsive reactions to market changes. Investors who develop long-term perspectives maintain their dedication to financial goals while building stronger resistance to market pressures. Sound investment strategies that incorporate psychological insights result in better decision-making and enable long-term sustainable growth. "

It becomes clear to every facet of the organization that they cannot perform their duties without understanding the data of where they come from, where they are, and where they want to go. "

The **Basel Accords**, which outlined the risk and governance framework, were notably overhauled, with particular emphasis on improved liquidity management and monitoring. This led institutions to invest more heavily in risk systems, both to meet requirements and to keep up with advancements in products and services.\n\nFollowing this, the LIBOR scandal of 2012 prompted swift regulatory action. The SARB is moving to replace the JIBAR rate with the **ZARONIA rate** as the new benchmark for ZAR instruments by 2026, aligning local regulations with international best practices. As mentioned, stricter reporting requirements demanded better risk management systems, leading to a massive step forward in risk evaluation. \n\n**Key takeaway:** \"Regulatory changes following the 2008 financial crisis and the adoption of advanced risk systems have reshaped the financial industry.\""
