The combination of strong technical talent, world-class engineering capabilities, and deepening financial markets gives India a unique competitive advantage. As more global capital flows into Indian exchanges, the demand for skilled quants, traders, and low-latency engineers will continue to grow. For individuals looking to build careers in the Indian markets, the next decade offers extraordinary upward mobility and a rare chance to be part of a once-in-a-generation financial transformation."
